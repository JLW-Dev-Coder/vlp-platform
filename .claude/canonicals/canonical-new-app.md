# canonical-new-app.md

Workflow for adding a new platform app to the VLP monorepo and bringing it to canonical standard. This is the playbook for app #10 and beyond.

---

## Purpose

Codifies the complete process of launching a new VLP ecosystem app — from concept to live production site at canonical standard. Ensures no file is missed, no canonical is skipped, and the process is repeatable without iterative discovery.

---

## Prerequisites (what the Principal Engineer must provide)

Before the Execution Engineer begins, the following must exist:

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Platform code** | 2–6 letter uppercase abbreviation | TAVLP |
| **Brand name** | Full product name | Tax Avatar Pro |
| **Brand abbreviation** | Short display name (for logo mark) | TAP |
| **Domain** | Production domain | taxavatar.virtuallaunch.pro |
| **Brand color** | Primary hex color | #ec4899 |
| **Font** | Display + body font | Sora |
| **Audience** | Who uses this product | Tax professionals (EAs, CPAs, attorneys) |
| **Pricing** | Pricing structure | $29/mo add-on to TCVLP |
| **Parent platform** | If add-on, which platform | TCVLP |
| **Homepage design** | Complete landing page HTML or detailed wireframe | tavlp-landing-v4.html |
| **Feature list** | 4–8 key features with descriptions | Custom avatar, weekly publishing, etc. |
| **Cal.com events** | Intro + support event slugs/namespaces | tax-monitor-pro/tax-avatar-virtual-launch-pro |
| **Intake/form endpoint** | Where form submissions POST | POST /v1/tcvlp/gala/intake |
| **Cross-platform links** | Which other VLP apps to link from footer | TCVLP, Tax Transcript AI |
| **Legal specifics** | Product-specific privacy/terms/refund language | YouTube data, HeyGen avatars, channel transfer |
| **Reference app** | Which existing app to clone structure from | apps/tcvlp/ |

---

## Phase 1: Scaffold (Day 1)

### 1.1 Create the app directory

```
apps/{abbrev}/
├── .claude/
│   └── CLAUDE.md              # Per canonical-claude.md template
├── app/
│   ├── (marketing)/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx         # MarketingHeader + MarketingFooter from @vlp/member-ui
│   │   ├── page.tsx           # Homepage (port the provided landing page)
│   │   ├── about/page.tsx
│   │   ├── features/page.tsx
│   │   ├── how-it-works/page.tsx
│   │   ├── pricing/page.tsx
│   │   ├── contact/page.tsx
│   │   ├── reviews/page.tsx
│   │   ├── reviews/submit/page.tsx
│   │   ├── sign-in/page.tsx
│   │   └── legal/
│   │       ├── privacy/page.tsx
│   │       ├── terms/page.tsx
│   │       └── refund/page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx             # Root layout (fonts, metadata, analytics)
│   ├── sitemap.ts
│   └── robots.ts
├── components/
│   └── marketing/
│       └── LandingPage.tsx    # Client component with ported homepage
├── lib/
│   ├── platform-config.ts     # PlatformConfig
│   └── metadata.ts
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── next.config.ts             # output: 'export' (or adapter-specific)
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── wrangler.toml
└── README.md                  # Per canonical-readme.md template
```

### 1.2 Create PlatformConfig

Must include all fields per `packages/member-ui/src/types/config.ts`:
- platformName, platformCode, brandAbbrev, brandName
- themeColor, domain, apiBaseUrl
- Cal.com: calBookingNamespace, calBookingSlug, calIntroNamespace, calIntroSlug
- routes: home, signIn, dashboard
- marketing: nav, footerResources, footerTagline, footerCopyright, ctaLabel, ctaPath, megaMenu

### 1.3 Wire shared components

- `MarketingHeader` + `MarketingFooter` from `@vlp/member-ui` in the marketing layout
- `ReviewDisplayPage` + `ReviewSubmitPage` for /reviews
- `LegalPageLayout` for legal pages
- `ContactPage` pattern for /contact with Cal.com embed

---

## Phase 2: Content (Days 1–2)

### 2.1 Port the homepage

Convert the provided HTML landing page into a Next.js client component. Rules:
- Line-by-line port — do NOT rewrite or simplify
- Keep all CSS as-is (namespaced under a data attribute to avoid bleeding into Header/Footer)
- Keep all vanilla JS in useEffect hooks
- Preserve every section, animation, and interactive feature

### 2.2 Create marketing pages

Per `canonical-site-nav.md` §1, every app needs:

| Page | Content source |
|------|---------------|
| /about | Principal Engineer provides narrative + context |
| /features | Derived from feature list provided in prerequisites |
| /how-it-works | Derived from homepage "How it works" section, expanded |
| /pricing | Derived from pricing structure provided |
| /contact | Cal.com embed + contact form |
| /reviews | Shared ReviewDisplayPage component |
| /sign-in | Shared auth components or placeholder |
| /legal/* | Adapted from reference app with product-specific language |

### 2.3 Create legal pages

Adapt from reference app. Must include product-specific language for:
- What data is collected
- How the service works (subscription, managed service, etc.)
- Cancellation and refund policy
- Third-party services used (HeyGen, YouTube, etc.)

---

## Phase 3: Canonical File Updates (Day 2)

These files in `.claude/canonicals/` must be updated when adding ANY new app:

### 3.1 Required updates

| File | What to update |
|------|---------------|
| `canonical-cal-events.md` | Add intro + support events to §3 registry table, update count |
| `canonical-feature-matrix.md` | Add new platform section with feature → route → R2 → D1 → frontend → status mapping |
| `canonical-feature-benefits.md` | Add human-readable benefit descriptions for each feature |
| `canonical-api.md` | Add any new Worker endpoints (if applicable) |
| `canonical-stack.md` | Add platform to the stack matrix table |
| `canonical-deploy.md` | Add deploy procedure (adapter type, project name, output dir) |
| `canonical-site-nav.md` | Add platform to Tools & Extras table in mega menu section |
| Root `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Add platform to §3 registry, §4 build table, §9 repo locations |

### 3.2 New files to create

| File | Template |
|------|----------|
| `apps/{abbrev}/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Per `canonical-claude.md` |
| `apps/{abbrev}/README.md` | Per `canonical-readme.md` |
| `apps/worker/contracts/{platform}/` | If new contracts needed |

---

## Phase 4: Infrastructure (Day 2–3)

### 4.1 Cloudflare Pages project

1. Create Pages project in Cloudflare Dashboard (or via Wrangler)
2. Add custom domain
3. Verify DNS (auto-configures if zone is already on Cloudflare)

### 4.2 CI/CD

Add to `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`:
- New job for the app
- Paths filter for `apps/{abbrev}/**`
- Dispatch option for manual deploys

### 4.3 Worker routes (if needed)

Add any new routes to `apps/worker/src/index.js`. Common patterns:
- R2 serving route for media assets (`/{prefix}/*`)
- Cron jobs for data refresh
- Intake/form endpoints

### 4.4 R2 asset organization

Media assets stored under `{platform}/` prefix in the `virtuallaunch-pro` bucket:
- `{platform}/videos/` — video content
- `{platform}/avatars/` — avatar images
- `{platform}/assets/` — general assets

---

## Phase 5: QA & Verification (Day 3)

### 5.1 Build verification

```bash
npx turbo build --filter={app}
```

All routes must prerender. No TypeScript errors. No blocking lint errors.

### 5.2 Page checklist

Every page must be checked in browser:

| Page | Check |
|------|-------|
| / (homepage) | All sections render, videos play, forms submit, animations work |
| /about | Content renders, responsive |
| /features | All features listed, responsive |
| /how-it-works | Steps render, responsive |
| /pricing | Tiers render, CTAs link correctly |
| /contact | Cal.com embed loads, form submits |
| /reviews | Empty state or reviews render |
| /sign-in | Auth flow works or placeholder renders |
| /legal/privacy | Content renders |
| /legal/terms | Content renders |
| /legal/refund | Content renders |
| /avatars (if applicable) | Media loads from R2 |

### 5.3 Cross-cutting checks

- [ ] Header nav links to all pages
- [ ] Footer links work
- [ ] Mobile responsive at sm/md/lg/xl breakpoints
- [ ] No hydration errors in console
- [ ] Favicon displays
- [ ] Page title and meta description set
- [ ] OG tags set for social sharing
- [ ] Forms POST to correct endpoints
- [ ] External links open in new tab
- [ ] Cal.com embeds load
- [ ] Videos play from R2
- [ ] No mixed content warnings

### 5.4 Design token compliance

Per `canonical-style.md` §11 self-check:
- [ ] Brand colors use blueprint §4.5 tokens
- [ ] Surfaces use surface.* tokens
- [ ] Typography uses correct scale (marketing OR app, not mixed)
- [ ] Buttons use canonical variants and sizes
- [ ] Containers use canonical max-widths (1280px marketing, 1200px app, 960px narrow)

---

## Phase 6: Production Deploy (Day 3)

### 6.1 Deploy

```bash
cd apps/{abbrev}
npx turbo build --filter={app}
npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name={pages-project-name}
```

### 6.2 Post-deploy verification

Run the full page checklist from §5.2 against the production URL.

### 6.3 Backup

Keep any previous static site as a one-command rollback until the new app is confirmed stable.

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Handoff (Day 3)

### 7.1 README

Create `apps/{abbrev}/README.md` per `canonical-readme.md` with all 14 sections filled in.

### 7.2 Marketing kit (in README)

Add a "Marketing Kit" section to the README:

```markdown
## Marketing Kit

| Asset | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Landing page copy | apps/{abbrev}/components/marketing/LandingPage.tsx |
| Feature descriptions | apps/{abbrev}/app/(marketing)/features/page.tsx |
| Avatar roster | R2: tavlp/avatars/ |
| Kennedy scripts | [ClickUp doc link] |
| Social proof | Phillip Gillian (YouTube), Conny R. (Facebook) |
| Competitor reference | IRS Client Machine by Tax Resolution Growth Academy |
| Brand color | #ec4899 |
| Font | Sora |
| Logo mark | TAP (pink play button on slate-950) |
```

### 7.3 Update global README

Add the new app to the monorepo root `README.md` platform registry table.

## What this prevents

- Forgetting to update canonical files (feature-matrix, cal-events, stack, etc.)
- Iterative discovery of missing pages ("oh, we also need /features")
- Hydration errors from dependency mismatches
- Inconsistent design tokens across apps
- Missing CI/CD configuration
- Undocumented deploy procedures
- No README for new contributors

---
