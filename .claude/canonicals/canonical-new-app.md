# canonical-new-app.md

Workflow for adding a new platform app to the VLP monorepo and bringing it to canonical standard. This is the playbook for app #10 and beyond.

---

## Purpose

Codifies the complete process of launching a new VLP ecosystem app — from concept to live production site at canonical standard. Ensures no file is missed, no canonical is skipped, and the process is repeatable without iterative discovery.

---

## Prerequisites (what the Principal Engineer must provide)

Before the Execution Engineer begins, the following must exist:

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Platform code** | 2–6 letter uppercase abbreviation | TAVLP |
| **Brand name** | Full product name | Tax Avatar Pro |
| **Brand abbreviation** | Short display name (for logo mark) | TAP |
| **Domain** | Production domain | taxavatar.virtuallaunch.pro |
| **Brand color** | Primary hex color | #ec4899 |
| **Font** | Display + body font | Sora |
| **Audience** | Who uses this product | Tax professionals (EAs, CPAs, attorneys) |
| **Pricing** | Pricing structure | $29/mo add-on to TCVLP |
| **Parent platform** | If add-on, which platform | TCVLP |
| **Homepage design** | Complete landing page HTML or detailed wireframe | tavlp-landing-v4.html |
| **Feature list** | 4–8 key features with descriptions | Custom avatar, weekly publishing, etc. |
| **Cal.com events** | Intro + support event slugs/namespaces | tax-monitor-pro/tax-avatar-virtual-launch-pro |
| **Intake/form endpoint** | Where form submissions POST | POST /v1/tcvlp/gala/intake |
| **Cross-platform links** | Which other VLP apps to link from footer | TCVLP, Tax Transcript AI |
| **Legal specifics** | Product-specific privacy/terms/refund language | YouTube data, HeyGen avatars, channel transfer |
| **Reference app** | Which existing app to clone structure from | apps/tcvlp/ |

---

## Phase 1: Scaffold (Day 1)

### 1.1 Create the app directory

```
apps/{abbrev}/
├── .claude/
│   └── CLAUDE.md              # Per canonical-claude.md template
├── app/
│   ├── (marketing)/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx         # MarketingHeader + MarketingFooter from @vlp/member-ui
│   │   ├── page.tsx           # Homepage (port the provided landing page)
│   │   ├── about/page.tsx
│   │   ├── features/page.tsx
│   │   ├── how-it-works/page.tsx
│   │   ├── pricing/page.tsx

│   └── marketing/
│       └── LandingPage.tsx    # Client component with ported homepage
├── lib/
│   ├── platform-config.ts     # PlatformConfig
│   └── metadata.ts
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── next.config.ts             # output: 'export' (or adapter-specific)
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── wrangler.toml
└── README.md                  # Per canonical-readme.md template
```

### 1.2 Create PlatformConfig

Must include all fields per `packages/member-ui/src/types/config.ts`:
- platformName, platformCode, brandAbbrev, brandName
- themeColor, domain, apiBaseUrl
- Cal.com: calBookingNamespace, calBookingSlug, calIntroNamespace, calIntroSlug
- routes: home, signIn, dashboard
- marketing: nav, footerResources, footerTagline, footerCopyright, ctaLabel, ctaPath, megaMenu

### 1.3 Wire shared components

- `MarketingHeader` + `MarketingFooter` from `@vlp/member-ui` in the marketing layout
- `ReviewDisplayPage` + `ReviewSubmitPage` for /reviews
- `LegalPageLayout` for legal pages
- `ContactPage` pattern for /contact with Cal.com embed

---

## Phase 2: Content (Days 1–2)

### 2.1 Port the homepage

Convert the provided HTML landing page into a Next.js client component. Rules:
- Line-by-line port — do NOT rewrite or simplify
- Keep all CSS as-is (namespaced under a data attribute to avoid bleeding into Header/Footer)
- Keep all vanilla JS in useEffect hooks
- Preserve every section, animation, and interactive feature

### 2.2 Create marketing pages

Per `canonical-site-nav.md` §1, every app needs:

| Page | Content source |
|------|---------------|
| /about | Principal Engineer provides narrative + context |
| /features | Derived from feature list provided in prerequisites |
| /how-it-works | Derived from homepage "How it works" section, expanded |
| /pricing | Derived from pricing structure provided |
| /contact | Cal.com embed + contact form |
| /reviews | Shared ReviewDisplayPage component |
| /sign-in | Shared auth components or placeholder |
| /legal/* | Adapted from reference app with product-specific language |

### 2.3 Create legal pages

Adapt from reference app. Must include product-specific language for:
- What data is collected
- How the service works (subscription, managed service, etc.)
- Cancellation and refund policy
- Third-party services used (HeyGen, YouTube, etc.)

---

## Phase 3: Canonical File Updates (Day 2)

These files in `.claude/canonicals/` must be updated when adding ANY new app:

### 3.1 Required updates

| File | What to update |
|------|---------------|
| `canonical-cal-events.md` | Add intro + support events to §3 registry table, update count |
| `canonical-feature-matrix.md` | Add new platform section with feature → route → R2 → D1 → frontend → status mapping |
| `canonical-feature-benefits.md` | Add human-readable benefit descriptions for each feature |
| `canonical-api.md` | Add any new Worker endpoints (if applicable) |
| `canonical-stack.md` | Add platform to the stack matrix table |
| `canonical-deploy.md` | Add deploy procedure (adapter type, project name, output dir) |
| `canonical-site-nav.md` | Add platform to Tools & Extras table in mega menu section |
| Root `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Add platform to §3 registry, §4 build table, §9 repo locations |

### 3.2 New files to create

| File | Template |
|------|----------|
| `apps/{abbrev}/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Per `canonical-claude.md` |
| `apps/{abbrev}/README.md` | Per `canonical-readme.md` |
| `apps/worker/contracts/{platform}/` | If new contracts needed |

---

## Phase 4: Infrastructure (Day 2–3)

### 4.1 Cloudflare Pages project

1. Create Pages project in Cloudflare Dashboard (or via Wrangler)
2. Add custom domain
3. Verify DNS (auto-configures if zone is already on Cloudflare)

### 4.2 CI/CD

Add to `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`:
- New job for the app
- Paths filter for `apps/{abbrev}/**`
- Dispatch option for manual deploys

### 4.3 Worker routes (if needed)

Add any new routes to `apps/worker/src/index.js`. Common patterns:
- R2 serving route for media assets (`/{prefix}/*`)
- Cron jobs for data refresh
- Intake/form endpoints

### 4.4 R2 asset organization

Media assets stored under `{platform}/` prefix in the `virtuallaunch-pro` bucket:
- `{platform}/videos/` — video content
- `{platform}/avatars/` — avatar images
- `{platform}/assets/` — general assets

---

## Phase 5: QA & Verification (Day 3)

### 5.1 Build verification

```bash
npx turbo build --filter={app}
```

All routes must prerender. No TypeScript errors. No blocking lint errors.

### 5.2 Page checklist

Every page must be checked in browser:

| Page | Check |
|------|-------|
| / (homepage) | All sections render, videos play, forms submit, animations work |
| /about | Content renders, responsive |
| /features | All features listed, responsive |
| /how-it-works | Steps render, responsive |
| /pricing | Tiers render, CTAs link correctly |
| /contact | Cal.com embed loads, form submits |
| /reviews | Empty state or reviews render |
| /sign-in | Auth flow works or placeholder renders |
| /legal/privacy | Content renders |
| /legal/terms | Content renders |
| /legal/refund | Content renders |
| /avatars (if applicable) | Media loads from R2 |

### 5.3 Cross-cutting checks

- [ ] Header nav links to all pages
- [ ] Footer links work
- [ ] Mobile responsive at sm/md/lg/xl breakpoints
- [ ] Mobile nav drawer overlays full viewport (not clipped by header — see 5.5)
- [ ] No hydration errors in console
- [ ] Favicon displays
- [ ] Page title and meta description set
- [ ] OG tags set for social sharing
- [ ] Forms POST to correct endpoints
- [ ] External links open in new tab
- [ ] Cal.com embeds load
- [ ] Videos play from R2
- [ ] No mixed content warnings

### 5.4 Design token compliance

Per `canonical-style.md` §11 self-check:
- [ ] Brand colors use blueprint §4.5 tokens
- [ ] Surfaces use surface.* tokens
- [ ] Typography uses correct scale (marketing OR app, not mixed)
- [ ] Buttons use canonical variants and sizes
- [ ] Containers use canonical max-widths (1280px marketing, 1200px app, 960px narrow)

### 5.5 Mobile nav drawer containment check

The shared MarketingHeader renders its mobile nav drawer as a
`position: fixed; inset: 0` element inside the header. If the
header (or any ancestor) applies any of these CSS properties, the
drawer's fixed positioning resolves against that ancestor instead of
the viewport, causing the drawer to render clipped inside the header
frame:

- `backdrop-filter` (any value other than `none`)
- `-webkit-backdrop-filter`
- `filter` (any value other than `none`)
- `transform` (any value other than `none`)
- `will-change: transform`
- `contain: paint` or `contain: layout`
- `perspective` (any value)

**QA step:** At 375px viewport, tap the hamburger menu and confirm the
nav drawer covers the full screen edge-to-edge. If it renders clipped
inside the header bar, one of the properties above is the cause.

**Fix pattern:** Neutralize the offending property on mobile in the
app's globals.css:

    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      header {
        backdrop-filter: none !important;
        -webkit-backdrop-filter: none !important;
      }
    }

This was first encountered on TPP (commit 8fe6363, 2026-05-11). The
shared MarketingHeader applies inline backdrop-filter for the
frosted-glass effect — !important is required to override the inline
style. Visual cost on mobile is negligible.

---

## Phase 6: Production Deploy (Day 3)

### 6.1 Deploy

```bash
cd apps/{abbrev}
npx turbo build --filter={app}
npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name={pages-project-name}
```

### 6.2 Post-deploy verification

Run the full page checklist from §5.2 against the production URL.

### 6.3 Backup

Keep any previous static site as a one-command rollback until the new app is confirmed stable.

---

## Phase 6.5: Deploy Verification Loop

The canonical deploy contract is **direct push to `main`** (per `canonical-deploy.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` §8 working rule #7). PRs are not part of the deploy workflow. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys from `main` on every push for static-export and `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` apps; TPP and TTMP deploy via GitHub Actions (`deploy-pages.yml` and `deploy-ttmp.yml`) on the same `main` push.

### 6.5.1 The loop (every change, every app)

```
make change → commit → push origin main → watch GH Actions run → smoke-check production URL
```

There is no PR step. There is no review queue. There is no `gh pr create`. RC commits and pushes directly to `main` per the standing instructions in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

### 6.5.2 Branches: when and why

Branches exist only for **in-progress multi-day work** that isn't safe to land incrementally on `main` (e.g., `feat/taxprep-app-10` was retained for the TPP launch as a discoverable launch boundary). When the work is ready, the branch is fast-forward or squash-merged into `main` locally — not via PR. Feature branches are deleted from origin and locally once their work has landed, except when explicitly preserved as a launch boundary.

### 6.5.3 What to watch after each push

- **Pages apps (static export + next-on-pages):** the corresponding `deploy-pages.yml` job in GitHub Actions, OR the auto-deploy run for the app's Pages project in the Cloudflare dashboard.
- **TTMP:** the `deploy-ttmp.yml` job (Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`).
- **Worker:** the `deploy-worker.yml` job (or `wrangler deploy` if pushed via local Wrangler).

If a deploy run fails, RC investigates and ships a follow-up commit to `main` — there is no rollback to a pre-push state because there is no pre-push state to roll back to. Rollback uses `git revert <bad-commit>` and the standard push loop (or, for static apps, `wrangler pages deployment retry/rollback` against the previous successful deployment).

### 6.5.4 What this rules out

- ❌ `gh pr create` for any change to a deployed app — PRs do not deploy
- ❌ Working on a branch and "saving up" the work for a single PR — direct, smaller commits to `main` are preferred
- ❌ Adding a `pr-checks.yml` GitHub Actions workflow — there is no PR queue to gate
- ❌ Treating "merged via PR" as deployed; only "pushed to `main`" means deployed

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Handoff (Day 3)

### 7.1 README

Create `apps/{abbrev}/README.md` per `canonical-readme.md` with all 14 sections filled in.

### 7.2 Marketing kit (in README)

Add a "Marketing Kit" section to the README:

```markdown
## Marketing Kit

| Asset | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Landing page copy | apps/{abbrev}/components/marketing/LandingPage.tsx |
| Feature descriptions | apps/{abbrev}/app/(marketing)/features/page.tsx |
| Avatar roster | R2: tavlp/avatars/ |
| Kennedy scripts | [ClickUp doc link] |
| Social proof | Phillip Gillian (YouTube), Conny R. (Facebook) |
| Competitor reference | IRS Client Machine by Tax Resolution Growth Academy |
| Brand color | #ec4899 |
| Font | Sora |
| Logo mark | TAP (pink play button on slate-950) |
```

### 7.3 Update global README

Add the new app to the monorepo root `README.md` platform registry table.

---

## What this prevents

- Forgetting to update canonical files (feature-matrix, cal-events, stack, etc.)
- Iterative discovery of missing pages ("oh, we also need /features")
- Hydration errors from dependency mismatches
- Inconsistent design tokens across apps
- Missing CI/CD configuration
- Undocumented deploy procedures
- No README for new contributors

---

## Relationship to other canonicals

| Canonical | Role in this workflow |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `canonical-app-blueprint.md` | Parent — all design decisions |
| `canonical-claude.md` | Template for app-level CLAUDE.md |
| `canonical-readme.md` | Template for app README |
| `canonical-site-nav.md` | Defines required pages and navigation structure |
| `canonical-style.md` | Design tokens for QA compliance |
| `canonical-deploy.md` | Deploy procedures to add to |
| `canonical-feature-matrix.md` | Feature registry to update |
| `canonical-feature-benefits.md` | Benefit copy to update |
| `canonical-cal-events.md` | Cal.com events to register |
| `canonical-stack.md` | Stack matrix to update |
| `canonical-api.md` | API registry to update |

---

## Decision log

| Date | Change | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-05-09 | Added Phase 6.5 "Deploy Verification Loop" codifying the direct-push deploy contract | The TPP launch (app #10) initially used PR-based deploys, which contradicts `canonical-deploy.md`. A hardening PR was originally going to teach the wrong process; corrected before landing. New apps deploy via direct push to `main` per `canonical-deploy.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` §8 working rule #7. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys from `main` on push. |
| 2026-05-11 | Added 5.5 mobile nav drawer containment check | TPP hamburger drawer was clipped inside header frame because backdrop-filter on header created a containing block for position: fixed descendants. Adding QA checkpoint so future apps catch this during scaffold. |
