# Tax Monitor Pro (TMP)

**Domain:** taxmonitor.pro
**Purpose:** Taxpayer-facing directory and membership platform

---

## 2. System Overview

### What this repo is

The frontend for Tax Monitor Pro — a Next.js static site that connects taxpayers with tax professionals. Taxpayers browse the directory, select a professional, and complete an intake-to-payment workflow. Tax professionals get listed and serve clients through a structured engagement pipeline.

### What this repo is NOT

- Not a backend — no Worker routes, no API handlers, no database access
- Not a CMS — content is either static or fetched from the VLP API
- Not a batch generation system — no cron jobs, no scheduled tasks

### Where it fits in the system

TMP is the consumer-facing frontend. All backend logic, auth, billing, contracts, and data storage are handled by the VLP Worker at `api.taxmonitor.pro`. TMP calls the VLP API exclusively through `lib/api.ts`.

## 6. Core Workflows

<!-- Phase 1+ -->

---

## 7. Data Contracts

Contracts are defined in the VLP repo at `contracts/registries/tmp-registry.json`. 47 contract JSON files exist locally in `contracts/` — these are pending migration to the VLP repo and should not be treated as authoritative.

---

## 8. Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 9. Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Next.js dev server |
| `npm run build` | Build static export |
| `npm run pages:build` | Build for Cloudflare Pages |
| `npm run deploy` | Build and deploy to Cloudflare Pages |

---

## 10. Environment

No environment variables in this repo. All configuration lives in the VLP Worker `wrangler.toml`.

---

## 11. Deployment

- **Platform:** Cloudflare Pages
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Output directory:** `out/`
- **Export mode:** Static export (no SSR)

---

## 12. Constraints

- No backend routes — all backend logic lives in VLP Worker
- No contracts defined here — contracts belong in VLP repo
- Auth uses `vlp_session` HttpOnly cookie managed by VLP Worker
- Do not delete legacy HTML until corresponding .tsx achieves full feature parity
- All API calls must target `api.taxmonitor.pro` (Custom Domain on VLP Worker)
- CSS Modules only — no Tailwind, no inline styles
- All fetch() calls via `lib/api.ts` only
