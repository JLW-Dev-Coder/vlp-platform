              <p className={styles.body}>
                Tax Monitor Pro is a platform that may allow tax professionals, firms, and related service providers to create profiles, submit credentials, request visibility, participate in verification workflows, receive inquiries, and access features tied to listing or client pool participation.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.bodySpaced}>
                The platform may also allow taxpayers or prospective clients to browse profiles, review limited profile information, and submit inquiries. Tax Monitor Pro is a marketplace-style visibility and connection platform. It is not a law firm, CPA firm, enrolled agent firm, tax resolution firm, referral guarantee service, or employment agency.

              </p>

                If you claim a credential, designation, license, admission, certification, firm affiliation, insurance status, or other professional qualification, you represent that the claim is truthful, current, and supportable.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.bodySpaced}>
                Tax Monitor Pro may request supporting documents or other information to review a claimed JD, attorney status, CPA license, EA status, firm identity, PTIN, state standing, or similar professional representation. You agree to provide requested materials promptly and accurately.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.bodySpaced}>
                Verification, if offered, means only that we completed some level of review based on information made available to us at the time. It does not mean endorsement, guarantee, fitness for a specific client matter, malpractice screening, disciplinary clearance, or ongoing monitoring of status unless expressly stated by us in writing.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.bodySpaced}>

                Tax Monitor Pro may route, display, or make available inquiries, leads, matches, or opportunities through a client pool or similar system. Access to these features may depend on plan level, geography, profile completeness, verification status, responsiveness, platform rules, internal quality controls, or other criteria we set.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.bodySpaced}>
                We do not guarantee any minimum number of inquiries, leads, matches, impressions, responses, conversions, clients, revenue, or business outcomes. Purchase of a plan, profile, feature, or visibility upgrade does not guarantee placement in front of any specific user or the receipt of any matter.
